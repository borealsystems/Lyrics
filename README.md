# Lyrics
Just Give Me Words On Screens

# What we want
- lyrics obviously
- searchable library
- the ability to put songs in service lists
- full screen output with support for theming (probably css) for use with hdmi
- full screen stage display output (probably just as big as the text can be, but will be css as well)
- hot keys for clearing output
- hot keys for different parts of songs
- inbuilt lyrics editor
- optional CCLI support

# Architecture Proposal

JSON files for storing lyrics
React for all UI and rendering?
Electron app or React Native?
